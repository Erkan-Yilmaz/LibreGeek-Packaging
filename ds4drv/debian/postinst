# This script typically completes any required configuration of the package foo once foo has been 
# unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb") file. Often, 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, 
# and/or warn the user that if he accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure
# that package as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any commands necessary to
# start or restart a service once a new package has been installed or upgraded.

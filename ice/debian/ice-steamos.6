.TH "ice-steamos" 6 "Ice-SteamOS Man Page" "Version 1.0.0"
.SH NAME
ice \- Utility to add ROMs to Steam BPM and make launching them much easier. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ice-steamos [option]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ice-steamos 
is a fork of the original upstream "Ice" program by Scott Rice.

.PP
Use Steam to play all your old games! Just because old consoles aren't sold anymore doesn't 
mean you can't enjoy their games. Ice leverages Steam's Big Picture mode to turn it into an 
emulator frontend (similar to Hyperspin). It accomplishes this by creating folders in 
specified locations on the user's hard drive, then adding any ROMs that are placed in these 
folders to Steam as non-Steam games.

.PP
The goal of this fork is to fix up Ice and tailor it for use on SteamOS. 
Debian packaging is in use to automate installation over using pip/python commands. 
pysteam, psutil, pysteam, and pastebin python packages were converted into Debian packages, 
which requires adding the SteamOS-Tools repository, noted below. ice-steamos follows the 
latest "stable" release (either upstream or deemed stable by us), and ice-steamos-unstable, 
which follows the latest upstream commits.

Re-run ice-steamos once more. For some reason, the first time you run ice, this may show up as a false positive.
This is being looked into.

  Subject: Re: OCB under BSD License?
  .
  Hi Thorvald,
  .
  Nice to hear from you, and to hear that OCB is in Mumble.
  .
  I am in fact planning to greatly broaden the patent grant; I just need to
  check with my attorney to see what's the best way to word it. Thanks for the
  excellent suggestion to include "all programs whose complete source code is
  freely available".  I will make sure to include this setting.  I am actually
  looking to go much further.
  .
  Anyway, until I get the wording figured out and on the web
  for a very general patent grant, please consider this email from me as
  explicit permission to include OCB in Mumble and distribute it under
  BSD (as well as GNU GPL) on a royalty-free basis.
  .
  Good luck, and thanks for creating your software.
  .
  phil

Description: Low latency encrypted VoIP client
 Mumble is a low-latency, high quality voice chat program for gaming.
 It features noise suppression, encrypted connections for both voice
 and instant messaging, automatic gain control and low latency audio
 with support for multiple audio standards. Mumble includes an in-game
 overlay compatible with most open-source and commercial 3D applications.
 Mumble is just a client and uses a non-standard protocol. You will need
 a dedicated server to talk to other users. Server functionality is
 provided by the package "mumble-server".

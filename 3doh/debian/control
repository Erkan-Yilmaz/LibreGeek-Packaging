Description: Mario Bros. with Portal guns!
 Two genre defining games from completely different eras, Nintendo's Super
 Mario Bros. and Valve's Portal. These two games managed to give Platformers and
 First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. But what if
 Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal
 gun mechanics?

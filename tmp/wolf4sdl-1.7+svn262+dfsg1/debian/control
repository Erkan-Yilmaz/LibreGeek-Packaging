Description: SDL-Port of Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny
 Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
 sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
 Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
 creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
 Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
 shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.
 .
 Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
 Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
 Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
 while taking advantage of some improvements.
 .
 The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available
 under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package
 contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are
 able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available
 Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.

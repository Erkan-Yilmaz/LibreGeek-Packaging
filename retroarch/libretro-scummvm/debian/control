Description: Libretro wrapper for ScummVM
 This wrapper makes ScummVM core API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its
 use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-
 and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The
 clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the
 games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed! 
 .
 ScummVM supports many adventure games, including LucasArts SCUMM games (such as
 Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, ...), many of Sierra's AGI
 and SCI games (such as King's Quest 1-6, Space Quest 1-5, ...), Discworld 1
 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress,
 Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of
 Kyrandia 1-3, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games 
 (including Freddi Fish and Putt-Putt games) and many more.

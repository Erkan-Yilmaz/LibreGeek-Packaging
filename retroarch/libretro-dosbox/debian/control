Description: Libretro wrapper for the DOSBox
 This wrapper makes DOSBox API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its use
 with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 DOSBox is a DOS-emulator that uses the SDL-library which makes DOSBox very easy
 to port to different platforms.
 .
 DOSBox also emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory
 FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics and a
 SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound card for excellent sound compatibility with
 older games.

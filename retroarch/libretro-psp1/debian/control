Description: Libretro wrapper for PSP1
 This wrapper makes PSP1 API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its use
 with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 PSP1 is a fork of PPSSPP with libretro API in mind.
 .
 PPSSPP can run your PSP games on your PC in full HD resolution. It can even
 upscale textures that would otherwise be too blurry as they were made for
 the small screen of the original PSP.

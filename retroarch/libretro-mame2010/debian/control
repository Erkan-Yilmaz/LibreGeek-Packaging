Description: Libretro wrapper for MAME 2010 (0.139)
 This wrapper makes MAME 2010 (0.139) core API compatible with libretro, thus
 allowing its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 MAME is a hardware emulator: it faithfully reproduces the behavior of many
 arcade machines (it is not a simulation). This program is not a game but can
 directly, through ROM images, run the complete system of these old arcade
 machines. These ROMs are subject to copyright and it is in most of the cases
 illegal to use them if you do not own the arcade machine.

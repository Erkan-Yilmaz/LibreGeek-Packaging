 PrBoom is the culmination of years of work by various people and projects on
 the Doom source code. PrBoom includes work from original Doom source release
 (by id Software), DosDoom, Boom, MBF, LxDoom and ISDLDoom. Of course ideas
 were exchanged with many other Doom ports, including xdoom, and Eternity.
 .
 PrBoom plays Doom, Doom II, Final Doom and other Doom IWAD mods.

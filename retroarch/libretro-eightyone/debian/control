Description: Libretro wrapper for EightyOne
 This wrapper makes EightyOne API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its
 use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 EightyOne is an emulator for several home computers made by Sinclair
 Research (And their clones) in the 1980s, such as Sinclair ZX81. As well as
 emulating the machines themselves, numerous addon cards are supported,
 including hi-res graphics, custom character sets, sound and colour cards.

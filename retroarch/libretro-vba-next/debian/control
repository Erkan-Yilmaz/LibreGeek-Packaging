Description: Libretro wrapper for VBA Next
 This wrapper makes VBA Next API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its use
 with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 VBA Next is a fork of VBA-M with notable improvements in performance. It is a
 Nintendo Game Boy Advance emulator with high compatibility with commercial
 games.
 .
 VBA-M is an improved fork from the inactive VisualBoyAdvance project, adding
 several features as well as maintaining an up-to-date codebase. After 
 VisualBoyAdvance became inactive in 2004, several forks began to appear such
 as VBALink, which allowed users to emulate the linking of two Gameboy devices.
 Eventually, VBA-M was created, which merged several of the forks into one
 codebase. Thus, the M in VBA-M stands for Merge.

 companies mentioned.

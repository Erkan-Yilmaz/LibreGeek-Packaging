Description: Libretro wrapper for Mupen64Plus
 This is a wrapper designed to make Mupen64Plus API-compatible with libretro,
 thus allowing its use with libretro frontends, such as Retroarch.
 .
 This is Parallel, an N64 Vulkan emulator using RDP and RSP. It is still
 part of the mupenpen64plus libretro fork.
 .
 Mupen64Plus is a cross-platform plugin-based Nintendo 64 emulator which is
 capable of accurately playing many games. Included are four MIPS R4300 CPU
 emulators, with dynamic recompilers for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64 systems,
 and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP), signal co-processor
 (RSP), and input. There is one included OpenGL video plugin, called RiceVideo.
 There are 3 other excellent video plugins being maintained by wahrhaft, called
 Arachnoid, Glide64, and Z64.

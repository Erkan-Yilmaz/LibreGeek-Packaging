Description: Libretro wrapper for the fMSX
 This wrapper makes fMSX API compatible with libretro, thus allowing its use
 with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 fMSX is a program that emulates MSX, MSX2, and MSX2+ 8bit home computers. It
 runs the majority of MSX software and mimics most popular hardware extensions,
 such as SCC, OPLL, etc.
 .
 fMSX was developed by Marat Fayzullin.

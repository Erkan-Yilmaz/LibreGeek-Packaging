Package: libretro-bsnes-mercury-accuracy
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: retroarch | libretro-frontend, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Libretro wrapper for bsnes-mercury accuracy core
 This wrapper makes bsnes-mercury accuracy core API compatible with libretro,
 thus allowing its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 This core is enabled to emulate only SNES hardware and its subsystems (from
 the command line only), like Super Game Boy, Satellaview and Sufami Turbo.
 .
 bsnes-mercury is a fork of higan, aiming to restore some useful features that
 have been removed, as well as improving performance a bit. Maximum accuracy is
 still uncompromisable; anything that affects accuracy is optional and off by
 default. The name is because metals are shiny, like the accuracy promises of
 bsnes, and mercury is the fastest metal.
 .
 This package comes with the bsnes-mercury accuracy core, which runs 100% of
 SNES games, with perfect emulation of the console. It requires high CPU usage.

 This package comes with the bsnes-mercury balanced core, which tries to keep
 a good balance between accuracy and performance. It runs almost all SNES games.

 This package comes with the bsnes-mercury performance core, which provides
 faster emulation at the cost of reduced accuracy, including problems with some
 games.

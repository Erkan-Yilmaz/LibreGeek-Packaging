    This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
 .
    The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
    non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
    whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
    (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
 .
    This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
    Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
    file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
    version without encryption capabilities).
 .
    If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
    NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.
 .
    This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".
 .
    The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
    http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
    Encryption is not supported.

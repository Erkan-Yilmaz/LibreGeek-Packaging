Description: Libretro wrapper for Game & Watch simulators
 gw-libretro is a libretro core that runs Game & Watch simulators.
 .
 It runs simulators converted from source code for the games available at
 MADrigal. Each simulator is converted with pas2lua, which was written
 specifically for this purpose, and uses bstree, which was also specifically
 written to obfuscate the generated Lua source code as per MADrigal's request.

 LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
 ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
 INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
 REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
 HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE
 OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
 confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
 creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
 original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
 ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
 and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
 she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the
 Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 limited to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
 data in a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
 the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
 thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
 medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of
 each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's
 heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
 subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any
 other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the
 Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of
 Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide,
 (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
 (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium
 and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of
 the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated
 claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case
 contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
 or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
 merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
 the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
 absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
 extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,
 Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
 permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
 a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 this CC0 or use of the Work.

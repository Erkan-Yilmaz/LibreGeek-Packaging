Source: https://github.com/yquake2
Disclaimer:
  This package is in the contrib archive area, which is not part of Debian.
  This package itself is free software, but it is only useful when combined
  with game data. In principle, freely licensed data analogous to OpenQuartz
  and OpenArena could be created for it, but the maintainers are not
  aware of any freely-licensed data that is compatible with Quake II.
Comment:
  The "orig" tarball was repackaged via git-import-orig to exclude
  support files for Windows and Mac OS, which included third-party
  software with source code not provided, and Objective C source whose
  copyright/licensing was unclear.

       capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
       explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"

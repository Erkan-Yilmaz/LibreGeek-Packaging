# Notes

Download the latest release from this site. The file should be named something like io_eliteforce-1.37.run.
Insert and mount your STVEF CD.
Make sure the file you downloaded is executable, then run it as root to install for all users:
cd downloads/
chmod +x io_eliteforce-1.37.run
./io_eliteforce-1.37.run
Once the installation is done, you can run the game under your normal user account by typing:
iostvoyHM
STVEF stores its config files in ~/.stvef/baseEF/, this is also the place to put additional maps.

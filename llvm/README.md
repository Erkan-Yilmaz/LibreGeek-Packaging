# About

This is a simple script to do a backport of [llvm](https://packages.debian.org/sid/llvm-3.8). A [bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=819072) in the 
Stretch version of this package indicates the Sid revision (3) or higher should be used. Typically, the `generic-building/backport-debian-package.sh` script
would be used here, but this contains several archives, not just an `orig.tar.gz` archive.

At some point, this may transition to the main backporting script.

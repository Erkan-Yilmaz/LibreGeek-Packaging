iortcw (1.42d+dfsg1-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * apparmor: add a child profile for the "safe mode" popups (tested
    with xmessage and zenity - kdialog will probably need more rules)
  * apparmor: don't try to run dh_apparmor on non-Linux ports
  * apparmor: #include the local snippets created by dh_apparmor
  * Add patch to replace __DATE__ with $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if set;
    that variable is set automatically by recent debhelper
  * Add Documentation key to the systemd services
  * Add a patch fixing some spelling mistakes in user-visible messages
    (but not "persistant", which is unfortunately part of the API)
  * Enable full compiler hardening

iortcw (1.42d+dfsg1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Please note that this upstream release changes the location of game
      files from ~/.iortcw to ~/.wolf.
    - debian/copyright: update
    - debian/rules: update get-orig-source
  * debian/scripts/rtcw.in: use ~/.wolf even in non-release snapshots that
    would normally use ~/.iortcw, for consistency
  * Add a patch to force the "autoupdate" mechanism to be disabled.
    This was off by default anyway, but if enabled, it would download and
    execute arbitrary code from Activision servers without authentication.
  * Switch Vcs-Git to https (see #810378)
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.7 (no changes needed)
  * Add experimental AppArmor profiles to protect the client and server,
    both in "complain" mode for now

iortcw (1.42b+20151119+dfsg1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream snapshot
    - build-depend on Freetype which is now enabled by default upstream
    - enable the new ARMv7 JIT on armhf, forcibly disable it elsewhere
      (avoiding uname)
    - debian/copyright: update
  * debian/rules: maintainer-get-orig-source: put the tarball in
    ../build-area

iortcw (1.42b+20150930+dfsg1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New package for Return to Castle Wolfenstein (Closes: #773742)
    - game-data-packager (>= 40) can package the required non-free data
  * Packaging based on ioquake3
  * Initial Debian changes, similar to ioquake3:
    - exclude non-Free lcc compiler (licensed for non-commercial use only)
    - exclude {MP,SP}/media: licensing unclear, and not needed
      (game-data-packager downloads and repackages an unofficial content patch
      from iortcw at the same time it downloads the official patch)
    - exclude Free third-party libraries too, to simplify license compliance,
      and use system copies of those libraries instead:
      cURL, Freetype, libjpeg, libogg, OpenAL, libopus, SDL2, libvorbis, zlib
    - run in a window by default per Games Team policy
    - disable auto-downloading by default since it is a security risk
    - reinstate checks for executable file overwriting and remove code to
      unpack arbitrary native code from (potentially auto-downloaded)
      game mods, fixing vulnerabilities similar to CVE-2011-3012 but
      breaking some mods as an unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect

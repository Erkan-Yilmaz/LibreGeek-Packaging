Description: engine for iD software's Quake
 This is a Vulkan API port of Quakespasm
 .
 vkquake is a Unix-friendly Quake engine based on the SDL port of the
 popular FitzQuake. It includes some new features, important fixes, and aims
 for portability and correctness.
 .
 This package contains no data files. To use it, you will need to either
 install the commercial Quake data, or alternative free data files such as
 OpenQuartz.
 .
 This engine is typically used via a script that launches it with a particular
 data set, such as the one found in the "quake" package.
